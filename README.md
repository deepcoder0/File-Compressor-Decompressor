# File-Compressor-Decompressor
Implemented a script to compress a text file using Huffman Technique and decompress it later.

To run or verify the script; user can pass the path of the file in the later part of the code.
For eg: path =  r'C:\Users\Deepanshu Aggarwal\Desktop\huffman.txt' ; (the complete location of the file)
Then you can try to compress and decompress the file.
After successful compression a message will be displayed 'Compressed'
